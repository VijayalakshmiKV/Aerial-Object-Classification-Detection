This project classifies aerial images into Bird or Drone using a custom CNN deep-learning model. It includes full preprocessing, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and a clean Streamlit app for real-time predictions. The dataset contains separate train, validation, and test splits for both bird and drone classes. The model outputs prediction probabilities along with a confidence score for each uploaded image. The project is structured for easy reproducibility and supports optional YOLOv8 object detection. All code, trained models, and documentation are organized for seamless deployment and extension.
